Given 3 doors to choose from, a door is removed and your asked if you want to swap your choice.  The odds of winning if you swap is 2/3 but if you stay its 1/3.

Heard about this in passing conversation, was curious if the odds was a thought experiment or practical also.  Curious enough to write a quick script but not just google the answer I guess...
